GLAM Workbench
==============

This is the source for a GLAM Workbench Murano package running on the
NeCTAR Research Cloud.

A Makefile is included to help the build process.

You will need your NeCTAR cloud credentials loaded and the Murano CLI tools
available in your path.

See https://glam-workbench.net/ for more details about the GLAM workbench.
